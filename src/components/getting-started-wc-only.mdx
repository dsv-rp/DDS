# Getting Started

## Basic Usage

If you are using a modern frontend framework, you can import the component and use it like this:

```js
import "@daikin-oss/design-system-web-components/components/button/index.js";

<daikin-button
  onClick={() => {
    toggleShowModal(true);
    changeModalAction(CREATE);
  }}
  data-testid="my-button"
>
  My Button
</daikin-button>;
```

You can also just use a plain script tag and import it that way.
However, you would have to import all the components you use, and then bundle it yourself.
This is very similar to how we recommend users who utilize Server Side Rendering (see below).

## Server Side Rendering

Currently there are some solutions available for running web components in your server before sending it off to the client.
However, at the time of this writing, there are too many steps and hurdles to jump over to get it to work.
We highly recommend creating a bundle of the components you use, and injecting it in a script tag (without deferring script execution).
This is considered an anti-pattern, especially because the whole point of SSRing your code is to prevent the client from downloading javascript files.
However, due to the small footprint of web components (roughly 17kb for a bundle w/30 components), it is a worthwhile trade-off in order to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content).

This [article](https://css-tricks.com/using-web-components-with-next-or-any-ssr-framework/) does a good job of outlining the steps.
